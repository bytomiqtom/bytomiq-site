  <!-- WHY WE BUILT BYTOMIQ -->
  <Section
    eyebrow="Why Bytomiq"
    title="Born from a decade inside digital marketing and SEO."
    body="Bytomiq was created after more than ten years working across digital marketing and SEO programs — from enterprise ecosystems with millions of URLs to high-growth challenger brands."
  >
    <div class="max-w-3xl text-sm text-bytomiq-muted space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        Through those environments, one pattern became unmistakable:
        <span class="text-slate-100 font-medium">
          The brands that win aren’t simply executing tactics. They’re operating from disciplined
          systems that turn SEO into a predictable lever.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        That insight shaped the foundation of Bytomiq. Instead of relying on scattered tools,
        one-off optimizations, or fragmented decision-making, we believe in:
      </p>

      <ul class="space-y-2">
        <li>· Engineering clarity into technical foundations</li>
        <li>· Structuring content around intent, not guesswork</li>
        <li>· Using experimentation to validate decisions, not inflate dashboards</li>
        <li>· Creating operating systems, not task lists</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Bytomiq exists to bring that level of rigor — the kind usually reserved for top enterprise teams —
        to every engagement. Our mission is simple:
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-100 font-medium">
        Give brands access to decision-grade SEO systems that scale, endure, and compound over time —
        no matter their size, stage, or constraints.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->

      <p><strong class="text-slate-100">Clarity over complexity.</strong><br/> Data should simplify decisions — not bury them.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-slate-100">Systems over heroics.</strong><br/> Predictable growth comes from structure, not improvisation.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-slate-100">Impact over activity.</strong><br/> We prioritize measurable lift, not motion disguised as progress.</p>
